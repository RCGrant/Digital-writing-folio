# First Impressions

</p>What I thought this was, is not what it has become. 
</p>

</p>Code is alien, a language of red, blue and black text.
I think I need to lie down...
</p>

</p>The inital readings seemed to only show one side of this course. We saw the finished product, the end of the production line, a hopeful future. I enjoyed my time exploring the various types of interactive stories, even finding joy in the short story 'shade'. Class felt more chaotic, an unrefined collision of creative types and numbers, trying to understand each other but only being partially successful.
</p>

</p>I usually writing on paper, straying from one genre to another. I prefer paper and pen because I am less reclined to edit as I go, less likely to lose hope or give up. It is a barrier I need to sit down and write.
</p>
</p>Better times must be ahead.

# Electronic Literature Collection
</p>VOLUME 1 and 2:
Was not accessible, as most of the technology used in the foundations of the pieces is now obsolete. I found this uncomfortable, as a lot of the stories required the reader to download unknown files from the internet, something that I am truly against.
</p>

</p>VOLUME 3:
I chose the hypertext story ‘The Brain Drawing the Bullet’ by Alan Trotter. Columns of text on a white background initially greet the reader. This story focuses on the concept of the unreliable narrator, which can be seen when the reader clicks onto the next column of text. With every click, the previous columns chop and change, moving the story of how Joan died in wildly different directions. At first, I didn’t notice the changes, as they are subtle; only after reading back due to confusion did I notice that the previous paragraphs now said something new. I would consider this piece E-lit, as it relies on hypertext to work, in print format, it would lose the key feature that makes this piece unnerving. I loved the confusion the story caused, it felt almost like the reader had taken on the role of the police and was stuck with sifting through the statements, trying to discover what was fact or fiction.</p>

</p>VOLUME 4:
I chose an interactive piece called ‘Living Will’ by Mark C. Marino. The story is set around a will, which changes depending on decisions you make. You can begin as the rich son or the lowly gardener. The only goal is to make it to the end with the most money, if you go into debt, you lose. I enjoyed this piece as it had a competitive edge to it, there was incentive to try and make the most of your decisions. Every decision taught me something new about the world Marino had built for this fiction piece, and I was able to play through the piece several times.
</p>

</p>Readings—Decolonize E-Literature? On weeding the E-Lit Garden
</p>
</p>This peer-reviewed piece was interesting, as I had no understanding of a lot of the terms used. First, second, and third gen E-lit were terms I didn’t know existed and were hard to grasp on the first read. I enjoyed the use of a walled garden as a metaphor for E-lit as a community. Personally, I believe that there are pros and cons whether the community brings down the wall or not. Unfortunately, in the society we live in, it is more likely a corporation will overtake the garden the moment it shows any form of profitability.
</p>
</p>Readings—Electronic Literature: What Is It?
</p>This website was incredibly hard to read, especially as the layout was not inviting. In this piece, the author sets out a history of E-literature in the modern world, setting out defining features of E-lit when compared to traditional print works. The author emphasises the relationship between evolving technology and E-lit and how, with each new innovation, new stories can be told. While I partially agree with the authors' main message, I also see the downside of this continued march forward. Eventually all that has come before will be lost, and unlike print copies, which can be saved or translated, E-lit faces a more permanent end.  
</p>

# Week Two - Enlightened Slots

</p>This weeks readings seemed to focus on variations of digital writing. In 'Englightening Interactive Fiction' I found the break down of the story 'Shade' to be interesting. Especially as the article focused on concepts I had missed before such as the tickets moving around the room.</p>

</P>I also began exploring the Electronic Literature Collection and discovered a few pieces that became addictive. 'The book you are looking for does not exist' and 'Living Will' were some of my favourites. I still don't understand a few of the pieces I interacted with, such as 'Masked Making'.
</p>
</p>Readings—Digital Poesis Impulse
</p>This piece explores why poets may turn to digital writing. This author argues that poets may find more room to experiment with language, formats, data, and chaos to produce new poems. While I agree with the author in terms of digital writing offering a new playground to create in, I believe that this new playground has, at times, the same restrictive feeling that writing traditionally can have, especially if you are not well versed in code or in the programs that assist with the digital writing.
</P>

# Week three - Remixed Chaos

</p>Im still wildly confused by coding. I have been running through this class trying not to break the fragile code that exists on the screen. My mindset has not changed that much, I did think about jumping ship this week but apparently subject change is now no longer possible. I don't believe that interacting with elit has changed how i read it. I think I am beginning to resent this class and the content that it teaches...</p>

</p>As for the new week 1 and 2 questions:</p>
</p>Taroko Gorge and Co cannot be printed. That is the simple difference between these elit pieces and printed lit. They read different because you have to actively interact with the pieces to read the full story. If you choose to only read the surface of any of these pieces, you will miss the main points. In Taroko Gorge, if you dont move your mouse across the green screen, you would not uncover the next line. If you dont write the next command in Shade, you would never find the plane tickets. Qualities that set these stories a part from traditional literature is the use of coding to create a bridge between the author and the reader. Without the code, these stories would not exist. Flash based elit is a prime example of this, where the code that underlines these stories has disappeared, so has the stories they used to tell.
</p>

# Week 5 Hypertext

</p>Ergodics is not a concept I have ever read about, and I will admit, I had to look up the word again before I could fully pursue the question. Ergodics refers to the idea that every part of a system will eventually visit/move through all parts of the space that the system exists within, whether that be at random or in a pattern. Using this explanation, I can agree with Aarseth's concept that hypertext is more of an alternative to conventional writing than something that replaces it. Both hypertext and conventional writing exist within the same system, both tasked with telling a story to the reader. However, hypertext creates the ability for the reader to participate in the formation of the story. They do not change the contents of the story, but readers can affect the way in which the story moves through the system, whether that be at random or in a pattern only they can see. In this way, the reader does not destroy the author's work but instead plays with it in the confines of the system created by the author. If the author chooses to, they still have the power to turn the story into something linear and more conventional. In its current ergodic state, however, the reader has the opportunity to explore the same story in many different ways, finding something new every time.</p>

</p>This real-time collaboration of author and reader cannot be found within traditional writing methods. However, the concept of hypertext itself is not too foreign to intimidate the reader and gives them the chance to focus and ignore parts of the story that may not interest them.</p>

# Ideas around Assessment two and three
</p>I have been bouncing from one idea to another, so I will list the top two in hopes that it will make the selection process easier.</p>

</p>Idea one: Spider web across screen, reader cuts the web between words to create their own poem. Simple black and white aesthetic, words relating to the modern world (excessive consumption, oversharing). Twine could probably be useful in the creation of this piece. I would draw images that the reader could click on and change. I think it would be time-consuming, with many creations of different images with all the choices available to the reader.</p>

</p>Idea two: A set of five riddles focusing on the obvious but ignored parts of our lives (poverty line, gender inequality, depression, homelessness, money). I don't know what platform I would need to make this on, as the reader would have to give the answers to the questions to move through the piece.</p>

</p>I don't know if I should go with something more rooted in visual cues or something that has a deep connection to the analogue world I am used to.</p>

# Reflection on past stories completed in Digital Writing
</p>House on the Hill by Lara J. Scuri</p>

</p>House on the Hill uses Bitsy to tell a story surrounding a haunted house. The reader uses the arrow keys and enter key to move through the story, reading dialogue and interacting with objects found in the house.</p>

</p>The use of bitsy deepened the interactive component of the story, especially as you could walk off the beaten track and interact with other parts of the house not meant to progress the story. The music sets the scene nicely, transporting the reader into a Scooby-Doo mystery environment. Scuri uses the technology aspect of the story to further strengthen the haunted themes within the story. This is most notable after talking with the strange presence in the study. After the conversation, the pixels that once illustrated a whole room distort into a maze of black squares that is jolting.</p>

</p>While Bitsy is easy to navigate for the reader, I felt the story was a bit restrained by the very technology used to tell it. Clicking through one or two lines of dialogue at a time took away from the broader story.</p>

</p>I was thinking of using Bitsy for my own final piece, but this interactive fiction story has made me think twice about such an idea. While as a reader I found the piece easy to follow, easy to move through, and engaging. I found the delivery choice of the actual story less than enjoyable. I think Bitsy would work for shorter pieces due to the restriction of the dialogue you can have on screen at any one time.</p>

# Week 7 - Paradox
</p>Readings – The Paradox of Poetic Gaming
</p>
</p>The key takeaway for me was said on page 127. The author compares traditional exhibitions and digital writing. This was fascinating to me, as it links back to ‘Decolonize E-Literature? On Weeding the E-Lit Garden,’ read in week one. When comparing the two forms of showing art, the author outlines that while public exhibitions are great spaces to interact with the public, digital writings, which are usually published on indie gaming sites, are easily accessible and are typically not bound to a start and an end date. I agree with the comparison and would like to add that when art is shown in a physical exhibition, that artwork is limited by the location, only reaching people in that area. Digital writing, however, has the potential to jump from country to country, reaching anyone who has access to the internet. 
</p>

# Week 8 - Presentations and feedback
</p>After speaking with some of my peers outside class and reading comments sent via email from Jenny, I believe I have a very clear picture of where I am going with this piece. I was on the fence about having the story loop itself, but Jenny’s encouragement has made me incorporate this detail. Some of my classmates were also very supportive of my idea and gave me the confidence to retry the submission button. I also spoke to them about my frustrations with deploying my story, with Mollie giving me several alternative options where I could publish without worrying about my use of JavaScript. The peer presentations I did see were very impressive, even in these early stages. Now that I understand all the backend work that is required just to get a passage to work, it has given me even more respect for my fellow peers.
</p>
</p>My to-do list is as follows:
</p>Tackle submission box
</p>Look into audio for different passages
</p>Retry interactive image maps
</p>

# Week 10 - A look back
</p>At the beginning of the semester, I had little in the way of expectations or even understanding of what this course entailed. I chose this course not because of the content, but because it was the only class that didn’t run through the majority of my nursing shifts. I was not as blindsided as some of my classmates but still had very little experience in the digital coding space. I had interacted with interactive fiction through games, programmes such as Twine and Bitzy were a mystery to me (Bitzy is still a bit vague). By week three, I fully realised the extensive amount of work that was required for this course to work. I was concerned about how that would work in my time-poor life, especially as code was something I had never tried to learn.
</p>
</p>While I don’t know if I’ve even scratched the surface of the coding space or even the digital writing space, I do feel more comfortable troubleshooting my own code and pushing my limits to try new things. In my final project especially, the format I chose was not covered in class, which meant I had no choice but to teach myself. This involved a mixture of trial and error, ChatGPT, and forums, which were sometimes goldmines or landmines. I felt I broke more twines than I created; however, I do still see myself using Twine and Glitch in my creative writing career.
</p>
</p>I feel that this course has done little to change my writing practice; it has opened up new avenues to tell my stories. The downside, of course, is that when you incorporate a computer into the success of your story, the amount of time required to make the story work triples. There were several weekends dedicated to getting small sections of code to either work or not break the rest of the story. For example, resizing the interactive images within SugarCube took four hours, while the click-replace function completely broke, leaving me with no way of replacing words within my piece.
</p>
</p>The biggest lesson I have taken from this course is that code is not for the faint of heart, and I envy those who have managed to tame this massive beast into telling their pieces the way they envisioned. While ‘Overshadowed’ is not exactly what I pictured, with the imitations appearing in the most unlikely places, I am happy that I have created a story that not only functions but imparts knowledge onto the reader.
