# First Impressions

</p>What I thought this was, is not what it has become. 
</p>

</p>Code is alien, a language of red, blue and black text.
I think I need to lie down...
</p>

</p>The inital readings seemed to only show one side of this course. We saw the finished product, the end of the production line, a hopeful future. I enjoyed my time exploring the various types of interactive stories, even finding joy in the short story 'shade'. Class felt more chaotic, an unrefined collision of creative types and numbers, trying to understand each other but only being partially successful.
</p>

</p>I usually writing on paper, straying from one genre to another. I prefer paper and pen because I am less reclined to edit as I go, less likely to lose hope or give up. It is a barrier I need to sit down and write.
</p>
</p>Better times must be ahead.

# Electronic Literature Collection
</p>VOLUME 1 and 2:
Not really accessible now that technology has moved on. Uncomfortable as alot of these pieces require downloading files off the interent, something that is against everything I was taught.
</p>

</p>VOLUME 3:
The Brain Drawing The Bullet by Alan Trotter- Hyper text story focusing on the unreliable author describe the scene of a murder. As you move through the piece, previous paragraphs you have already read, chop and change, moving the story of how Joan died in wildly different directions. I would consider this elit as it relys on hypertext to work, you would not be able to print this story onto paper. I loved the confusion the story caused, it felt like I was the police interviewing witnesses and suspects.</p>

</p>VOLUME 4:
Living Will by Mark C. Marino - An interactive fiction story using HTML, javascript and undum. The story is set around a will which changes depending on decisions you make. You can begin as the rich son or the lowly gardener. The only goal is to make it to the end with the mosy money, if you go into debt, you lose. I loved this piece because it felt like I was playing a game, with a clear finish line. Every decision taught me something new about the world that had been built by Marino.

# Week Two - Enlightened Slots

</p>This weeks readings seemed to focus on variations of digital writing. In 'Englightening Interactive Fiction' I found the break down of the story 'Shade' to be interesting. Especially as the article focused on concepts I had missed before such as the tickets moving around the room.</p>

</P>I also began exploring the Electronic Literature Collection and discovered a few pieces that became addictive. 'The book you are looking for does not exist' and 'Living Will' were some of my favourites. I still don't understand a few of the pieces I interacted with, such as 'Masked Making'.

# Week three - Remixed Chaos

</p>Im still wildly confused by coding. I have been running through this class trying not to break the fragile code that exists on the screen. My mindset has not changed that much, I did think about jumping ship this week but apparently subject change is now no longer possible. I don't believe that interacting with elit has changed how i read it. I think I am beginning to resent this class and the content that it teaches...</p>

</p>As for the new week 1 and 2 questions:</p>
</p>Taroko Gorge and Co cannot be printed. That is the simple difference between these elit pieces and printed lit. They read different because you have to actively interact with the pieces to read the full story. If you choose to only read the surface of any of these pieces, you will miss the main points. In Taroko Gorge, if you dont move your mouse across the green screen, you would not uncover the next line. If you dont write the next command in Shade, you would never find the plane tickets. Qualities that set these stories a part from traditional literature is the use of coding to create a bridge between the author and the reader. Without the code, these stories would not exist. Flash based elit is a prime example of this, where the code that underlines these stories has disappeared, so has the stories they used to tell.

# Week 5 Hypertext

</p>Ergodics is not a concept I have ever read about and I will admit, I had to look up the word again before I could fully pursue the question. Ergodics refers to the idea that every part of a system will eventually visit/move through all parts of the space that the system exists within, whether that be at random or in a pattern. Using this explanation, I can agree with Aarseth's concept that hypertext is more of a alternative to conventional writing then something that replaces it. Both hypertext and conventional writing exist within the same system, both tasked with telling a story to the reader. However hypertext creates the ability for the reader to participate in the formation of the story. They do not change the contents of the story, but readers can affect the way in which the story moves through the system, whether that be at random or in a pattern only they can see. In this way, the reader does not destory the author's work, but instead plays with it in the confines of the system created by the author. If the author chooses to, they still have the power to turn the story into some linear, more conventional. In its current ergodic state however, the reader has the oppotunity to explore the same story in many different ways, finding something new every time.</p>

</p>This real time collaboration of author and reader cannot be found within traditional writing methods. However the concept of hypertext itself is not too foriegn to intimidate the reader and gives them the chance to focus and ignore parts of the story that may not interest them.</p>

# Ideas around Assessment two and three
</p>I have been bouncing from one idea to another, so I will list the top two in hopes that it will make the selection process easier.</p>

</p>Idea one: Spider web across screen, reader cuts the web between words to create their own poem. Simple black and white asthetic, words relating to the modern world (excessive consumption, oversharing). Twine could probably be useful in the creation of this piece. I would draw images that the reader could click on and change. I think it would be time consuming, with many creations of different images with all the choices available to the reader.</p>

</p>Idea two: A set of five riddles focusing on the obvious but ignored parts of our lives (poverty line, gender inequality, depression, homelessness, money). I don't know what platform I would need to make this on as the reader would have to give the answers to the questions to move through the piece.</p>

</p>I don't know if I should go with something more rooted in visual cues or something that has a deep connection to the analog world I am used to.</p>

# Reflection on past stories completed in Digital Writing
</p>House on the Hill by Lara J. Scuri</p>

</p>House on the Hill uses Bitsy to tell a story surrounding a haunted house. The reader uses the arrow keys and enter key to move through the story, reading dialogue and interacting with objects found in the house.</p>

</p>The use of bitsy deepened the interactive component of the story, especially as you could walk off the beaten track and interact with other parts of the house not meant to progress the story. The music sets the scene nicely, transporting the reader into a Scooby-Doo mystery environment. Scuri uses the technology aspect of the story to further strengthen the haunted themes within the story. This is most notable after talking with the strange presence in the study. After the conversation, the pixels that once illustrated a whole room distort into a maze of black squares that is jolting.</p>

</p>While Bitsy is easy to navigate for the reader, I felt the story was a bit restrained by the very technology used to tell it. Clicking through one or two lines of dialogue at a time took away from the broader story.</p>

</p>I was thinking of using Bitsy for my own final piece, but this interactive fiction story has made me think twice about such an idea. While as a reader I found the piece easy to follow, easy to move through, and engaging. I found the delivery choice of the actual story less than enjoyable. I think Bitsy would work for shorter pieces due to the restriction of the dialogue you can have on screen at any one time.</p>
