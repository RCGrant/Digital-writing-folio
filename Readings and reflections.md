# First Impressions

</p>What I thought this was, is not what it has become. 
</p>

</p>Code is alien, a language of red, blue and black text.
I think I need to lie down...
</p>

</p>The inital readings seemed to only show one side of this course. We saw the finished product, the end of the production line, a hopeful future. I enjoyed my time exploring the various types of interactive stories, even finding joy in the short story 'shade'. Class felt more chaotic, an unrefined collision of creative types and numbers, trying to understand each other but only being partially successful.
</p>

</p>I usually writing on paper, straying from one genre to another. I prefer paper and pen because I am less reclined to edit as I go, less likely to lose hope or give up. It is a barrier I need to sit down and write.
</p>
</p>Better times must be ahead.

#Electronic Literature Collection
</p>VOLUME 1 and 2
Not really accessible now that technology has moved on. Uncomfortable as alot of these pieces require downloading files off the interent, something that is against everything I was taught.
</p>

</p>VOLUME 3
The Brain Drawing The Bullet by Alan Trotter- Hyper text story focusing on the unreliable author describe the scene of a murder. As you move through the piece, previous paragraphs you have already read, chop and change, moving the story of how Joan died in wildly different directions. I would consider this elit as it relys on hypertext to work, you would not be able to print this story onto paper. I loved the confusion the story caused, it felt like I was the police interviewing witnesses and suspects.</p>

</p>VOLUME 4
Living Will by Mark C. Marino - An interactive fiction story using HTML, javascript and undum. The story is set around a will which changes depending on decisions you make. You can begin as the rich son or the lowly gardener. The only goal is to make it to the end with the mosy money, if you go into debt, you lose. I loved this piece because it felt like I was playing a game, with a clear finish line. Every decision taught me something new about the world that had been built by Marino.

# Week Two - Enlightened Slots

</p>This weeks readings seemed to focus on variations of digital writing. In 'Englightening Interactive Fiction' I found the break down of the story 'Shade' to be interesting. Especially as the article focused on concepts I had missed before such as the tickets moving around the room.</p>

</P>I also began exploring the Electronic Literature Collection and discovered a few pieces that became addictive. 'The book you are looking for does not exist' and 'Living Will' were some of my favourites. I still don't understand a few of the pieces I interacted with, such as 'Masked Making'.

# Week three - Remixed Chaos

</p>Im still wildly confused by coding. I have been running through this class trying not to break the fragile code that exists on the screen. My mindset has not changed that much, I did think about jumping ship this week but apparently subject change is now no longer possible. I don't believe that interacting with elit has changed how i read it. I think I am beginning to resent this class and the content that it teaches...</p>

</p>As for the readings:</p>
