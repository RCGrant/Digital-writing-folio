# Assessment three
# Planning stage

</p>The original idea was simple, but has grown in size over the one week easter holiday.</p>
</p>Original idea two: A set of five riddles focusing on the obvious but ignored parts of our lives (poverty line, gender inequality, depression, homelessness, money). 
I don't know what platform I would need to make this on as the reader would have to give the answers to the questions to move through the piece.</p>

</p>The new, big idea: Readers will follow an un-named character through their descend from the poverty line to homelessness. Readers will solve riddles to move to the next stage of the story. These stages will be accompanied by hand drawn pictures and facts collected in Australia about the issues faced by the main character.</p>

</p>I have completed a rough story board and managed to upload the images into a files folder on github (there may have been some googling around how to do this). This story board outlines the bones of my piece, without the addition of the full story that will be in the final piece.</p>
