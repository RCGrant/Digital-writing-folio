# Assessment three
# Planning stage

</p>The original idea was simple, but has grown in size over the one week easter holiday.</p>
</p>Original idea two: A set of five riddles focusing on the obvious but ignored parts of our lives (poverty line, gender inequality, depression, homelessness, money). 
I don't know what platform I would need to make this on as the reader would have to give the answers to the questions to move through the piece.</p>

</p>The new, big idea: Readers will follow an unnamed character through their descent from the poverty line to homelessness. Readers will solve riddles to move to the next stage of the story. These stages will be accompanied by hand-drawn pictures and facts collected in Australia about the issues faced by the main character.</p>

</p>I have completed a rough storyboard and managed to upload the images into a files folder on GitHub (there may have been some Googling around how to do this). This storyboard outlines the bones of my piece, without the addition of the full story that will be in the final piece.</p>

# Draft story to go along with the riddles

</p>The keys are in your pocket, or maybe at the bottom of your work bag. You cast back to this morning but honestly you can’t remember. You can feel the dark circles under your eyes and the emptiness of your stomach. You left lunch on the kitchen table.</p>

</p>You eat the sandwich you made for lunch over the kitchen sink. You wash that don’t with a glass of water. The house is quiet, your laptop is on. You job search, you apply, you get rejected. You aren’t who they’re looking for.</p>

</p>How many times have you repeated this cycle? How many times can you keep doing this? You were accidentally given your co-workers payslip today. The title is the same, but the hourly is different. It already knew that was true, but it hurts anyway.</p>

</p>Why do you get out of bed at all? What’s the point? Just stay here for another hour, no one is going to miss you. The only mail that you receive are bills. The effort it takes to get from the bed to the bathroom is marathon like. How did two hours pass? You only took three steps.</p>

</p>You find the keys at the bottom of your old work bag. The landlord probably changed the locks after you left. You try to remember your old front door, but its all jumbled up. You can feel the dark circles under your eyes and the emptiness of your stomach. You raise your cardboard sign.</p>

# First draft woes

</p>I am already losing my mind. Multiple parts of this project are not going right, and I have limited knowledge of how to fix any of these issues. The submit box will not work for me, even with the assistance of ChatGPT. Even more frustrating is that, no matter what I do, I cannot get my Twine to deploy properly on GitHub, even though I have been able to do this before. I have attempted a few different ways with little change. I have attempted defeat for now and have uploaded several screenshots of my code breaking into my images folder found in my portfolio.</p>

</p>I will give myself a few days to find the energy once again to successfully deploy my Twines with GitHub...
</p>

</p>I got the thing working! Prototype below.</p>

</p>Broken code: Still unable to get these deployed links to work. Different error messages.</p>

# Final Story
</p>The keys are in your pocket, or maybe at the bottom of your work bag. You cast your mind back to this morning but honestly you can't remember. You can feel the dark circles under your eyes and the emptiness of your stomach. You left lunch on the kitchen table.  
</p>
</p>You reach out for the door handle...
</p>
</p>'I live throughout people's lives without second thought or compromise, I can be found plain as day yet I am so easily ignored, I affect those already down on their luck, I am unwavering in my intensity.' What am I?
</p>
</p>Answer: The poverty line
As of 2022, 3.3 million people in Australia live under the poverty line.
</p>
</p>You find your key at the bottom of your bag, underneath your wafer-thin wallet and enter your shabby apartment. You drop your bag on the floor and move towards the kitchen.
You eat the sandwich you made for lunch over the kitchen sink. You wash that down with a glass of water. The house is quiet, your laptop is on. You job search, you apply, you get rejected. You aren’t who they’re looking for.
</p>
</p>In the dead of night, you dream about the sink, a shimmer of gold coming from underneath the drain cap. You reach out…
</p>
</p>'Before I exist, I am disliked. I struggle for light when there is plenty, I hear whispers that I am not good enough, but no one will confront me. I have equal worth, yet no one believes me.'
What am I?
</p>
</p>Answer: A woman
From 2022-2023, 1 woman was killed every 11 days by a current or former partner.
</p>
</p>On your way to work, you spot a bunch of sunflowers. You have the urge to pick them from their stems...
</p>
</p>How many times have you repeated this cycle? How many times can you keep doing this? You were accidentally given your co-workers payslip today. The title is the same, but the hourly is different. You already knew that truth, but it hurts anyway.
</p>
</p>'I am a black cloud, a shadow that darkens every hall, the thing that traps you in between the sheets of your bed and glues you to your screen. I have deadly consequences if left unchecked.'
What am I?
</p>
</p>Answer: Depression
From 2020-2022, it was estimated that 1 in 5 Australians experienced a mental health disorder. 
Something is growing, no consuming every other feeling inside of you.
</p>
</p>Why do you get out of bed at all? What’s the point? Just stay here for another hour, no one is going to miss you. The only mail that you receive are bills. The effort it takes to get from the bed to the bathroom is marathon like. How did two hours pass? You only took three steps.
</p>
</p>'I am a concept you avoid eye contact with; I love the city as much as you do. People only find me when they have something to give or when they need something they can no longer obtain on their own. Governments believe I am an eyesore, but they fail to recognise that I am in fact a symptom.'
What am I?
</p>
</p>Answer: Homelessness
On censes night in 2021, an estimated 122,494 people were experiencing homelessness in Australia. 
</p>
</p>You find the keys at the bottom of your old work bag. The landlord probably changed the locks after you left. You try to remember your old front door, but its all jumbled up. You can feel the dark circles under your eyes and the emptiness of your stomach. You raise your cardboard sign.
The end?
</p>
</p>You make your way into a shelter and stay one, two, three nights.
You reach out to family, friends, strangers and one offers you a small room to sleep in.
You find a part time job washing dishes in a restaurant, cleaning offices at night, making burgers for teenagers. You grind, every cent going towards the next necessity.
You manage to save.
You find a studio apartment.
You sleep on the floor, don’t turn the heating or the lights on, you eat at the local soup kitchen.
You find organisations, charities and reach out. You finally have food in the fridge, a mattress on the floor, shampoo to properly wash your hair.
You get a second job.
You finish another double shift and arrive at your Door.

# The 16th and 17th of May—make or break
</p>I have dedicated hours to this project, most of which was spent troubleshooting code that either was completely broken or, in some cases, just one character wrong. I started the submission box problem from scratch, creating entire passages to just contain this code, and it seems to be working. Jenny’s feedback has greatly helped my understanding of naming bits of code correctly so that they only ‘fire’ at the right time. I have also managed to create multiple image maps, which were originally too big for the piece. I discovered that in SugarCube, it’s much harder to scale things such as image maps, and I was forced to comb through forums, looking for a solution. I did find a long piece of code written by David J. Bradshaw, which resolved this issue. The other issue I have found is that the click-replace function does not work in SugarCube. I have failed to find a way around this.
</p>
</p>Forgot to add that I have managed to get the system to recognise multiple correct answers for the riddles, hopefully reducing variations of the correct answers being rejected.
</p>

# Audio Mountain—Moving to Dropbox
</p>I tackled adding audio today. I went to ChatGPT, as I found a lot of the resources provided by Jenny simply don’t work with SugarCube. Unfortunately, I figured out early on that Twine doesn’t seem to like it when I place audio in the local folder, nor did it want to play the audio when Twine was first opened. After some trial and error and more internet searching, I found the best way around this was to move my audio into a Dropbox. I also moved my images so that they were all in the same place. I also added in a play button on the first passage so that the music would play automatically after the first passage. I retried the SugarCube version of click replace, but I have decided to abandon it due to the complex nature of replacing the words.
