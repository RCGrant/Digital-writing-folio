# Assessment three
# Planning stage

</p>The original idea was simple, but has grown in size over the one week easter holiday.</p>
</p>Original idea two: A set of five riddles focusing on the obvious but ignored parts of our lives (poverty line, gender inequality, depression, homelessness, money). 
I don't know what platform I would need to make this on as the reader would have to give the answers to the questions to move through the piece.</p>

</p>The new, big idea: Readers will follow an un-named character through their descend from the poverty line to homelessness. Readers will solve riddles to move to the next stage of the story. These stages will be accompanied by hand drawn pictures and facts collected in Australia about the issues faced by the main character.</p>

</p>I have completed a rough story board and managed to upload the images into a files folder on github (there may have been some googling around how to do this). This story board outlines the bones of my piece, without the addition of the full story that will be in the final piece.</p>

# Draft story to go along with the riddles

</p>The keys are in your pocket, or maybe at the bottom of your work bag. You cast back to this morning but honestly you can’t remember. You can feel the dark circles under your eyes and the emptiness of your stomach. You left lunch on the kitchen table.</p>

</p>You eat the sandwich you made for lunch over the kitchen sink. You wash that don’t with a glass of water. The house is quiet, your laptop is on. You job search, you apply, you get rejected. You aren’t who they’re looking for.</p>

</p>How many times have you repeated this cycle? How many times can you keep doing this? You were accidentally given your co-workers payslip today. The title is the same, but the hourly is different. It already knew that was true, but it hurts anyway.</p>

</p>Why do you get out of bed at all? What’s the point? Just stay here for another hour, no one is going to miss you. The only mail that you receive are bills. The effort it takes to get from the bed to the bathroom is marathon like. How did two hours pass? You only took three steps.</p>

</p>You find the keys at the bottom of your old work bag. The landlord probably changed the locks after you left. You try to remember your old front door, but its all jumbled up. You can feel the dark circles under your eyes and the emptiness of your stomach. You raise your cardboard sign.</p>
