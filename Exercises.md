# Coding playground
https://learning--i-think.glitch.me/

</p>Changes to the remix: I played around with all aspects of this playground. I changed the GIF, background picture, colours in the background and on particular cards (with some success), text responses, and emojis. I had moments of both anger and happiness. I didn't completely change the Taroko Gorge poem, as I liked some of the words already coded into the generator; I did, however, add a few of my own. I don’t know if this remix is considered successful, I am just happy that the website doesn’t seem to be completely broken now that I have changed the code in several places.

# Dadaist Poem remixed

# Lipogram - No letter e
</p>Art is marginal, mind numbing, a morticians cold cuts and hot chai.</p>
</p>Art is tinnitus, narcassistic, a narcotic that sticks to your hair.</p>
</p>Art is nobody in particular, a fly stuck on my window.</p>
</p>Art is that man, that dog, that bird, that limp plant in your living room.</p> 
</p>Art is lost lands of sand and pollution and salt flats, footprints sinking into soft soil.</p>

# Mesostics using the word Impulse
</p>Illusion, grandous feelings that have no place</p>
</p>circle of people, Mulled wine with rosy lips</p>
</p>Painting with fingerprints</p>
</p>high hats and Umbrellas and waistcoats and watchchains</p>
</p>Lucid dreaming, long nights</p>
</p>naSty little people in my ear</p>
</p>last time i saw you hEre, was the beginning of our late nights</p>
