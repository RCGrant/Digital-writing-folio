# First Impressions

</p>What I thought this was, is not what it has become. 
</p>

</p>Code is alien, a language of red, blue and black text.
I think I need to lie down...
</p>

</p>The inital readings seemed to only show one side of this course. We saw the finished product, the end of the production line, a hopeful future. I enjoyed my time exploring the various types of interactive stories, even finding joy in the short story 'shade'. Class felt more chaotic, an unrefined collision of creative types and numbers, trying to understand each other but only being partially successful.

</p>Better times must be ahead.

# Week Two - Enlightened Slots

</p>This weeks readings seemed to focus on variations of digital writing. In 'Englightening Interactive Fiction' I found the break down of the story 'Shade' to be interesting. Especially as the article focused on concepts I had missed before when I had interacted with 'Shade' such as the tickets moving around the room.</p>

</P>I also began exploring the Electronic Literature Collection and discovered a few pieces that became addictive. 'The book you are looking for does not exist' and 'Living Will' were some of my favourites. I still don't understand a few of the pieces I interacted with, such as 'Masked Making'.
