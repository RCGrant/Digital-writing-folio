# Coding playground
https://learning--i-think.glitch.me/

</p>Changes to the remix: I played around with all of the aspects of this playground. I changed the GIF, background picture, colours in the background and on particular cards (with some success), text responses and emojis. I had both moments of anger and happiness. I didn't completely change the Taroko Gorge poem as I liked some of the words already coded into the generator. I did however add a few of my own. I dont know if this remix is considered successful, I am just happy that the website doesnt seem broken and you can actually interact with everything.

# Dadaist Poem remixed

# Lipogram - No letter e
Art is marginal, mind numbing, a morticians cold cuts and hot chai. Art is tinnitus, narcassistic, a narcotic that sticks to your hair. Art is nobdy in particular, a fly stuck on my window. Art is that man, that dog, that bird, that lip plant in your living room. Art is lost lands of sand and pollution and salt flats, footprints sinking into soft soil.

# Mesostics
I*llusion, grandous feelings that have no place
circle of people, M*ulled wine with rosy lips
P*ainting with fingerprints
high hats and U*mbrellas and waistcoats and watchchains
L*ucid dreaming, long nights
last time i saw you h*E*re, was the beginning of our lat nights
