# First Impressions

</p>What I thought this was, is not what it has become. 
</p>

</p>Code is alien, a language of red, blue and black text.

</p>The inital readings seemed to only show one side of this course. We saw the finished product, the end of the production line, a hopeful future. I enjoyed my time exploring the various types of interactive stories, even finding joy in the short story 'shade'. Class felt more chaotic, an unrefined collision of creative types and numbers, trying to understand each other but only being partially successful.

</p>Better times must be ahead.
