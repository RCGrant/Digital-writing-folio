# Coding playground
https://learning--i-think.glitch.me/

</p>Changes to the remix: I played around with all of the aspects of this playground. I changed the GIF, background picture, colours in the background and on particular cards (with some success), text responses and emojis. I had both moments of anger and happiness. I didn't completely change the Taroko Gorge poem as I liked some of the words already coded into the generator. I did however add a few of my own. I dont know if this remix is considered successful, I am just happy that the website doesnt seem broken and you can actually interact with everything.
