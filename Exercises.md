# First Impressions

</p>What I thought this was, is not what it has become. 
</p>

</p>Code is alien, a language of red, blue and black text.
I think I need to lie down...
</p>

</p>The inital readings seemed to only show one side of this course. We saw the finished product, the end of the production line, a hopeful future. I enjoyed my time exploring the various types of interactive stories, even finding joy in the short story 'shade'. Class felt more chaotic, an unrefined collision of creative types and numbers, trying to understand each other but only being partially successful.

</p>Better times must be ahead.

# Week Two - Enlightened Slots

</p>This weeks readings seemed to focus on variations of digital writing. In 'Englightening Interactive Fiction' I found the break down of the story 'Shade' to be interesting. Especially as the article focused on concepts I had missed before such as the tickets moving around the room.</p>

</P>I also began exploring the Electronic Literature Collection and discovered a few pieces that became addictive. 'The book you are looking for does not exist' and 'Living Will' were some of my favourites. I still don't understand a few of the pieces I interacted with, such as 'Masked Making'.

# Week three - Remixed Chaos

</p>Im still wildly confused by coding. I have been running through this class trying not to break the fragile code that exists on the screen. My mindset has not changed that much, I did think about jumping ship this week but apparently subject change is now no longer possible. I don't believe that interacting with elit has changed how i read it. I think I am beginning to resent this class and the content that it teaches...</p>
