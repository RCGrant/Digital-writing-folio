# Ruby Grant 
Writer, nurse currently living and studying in Melbourne, Australia. Current interests lie in writing escapist fantasy and science fiction with a focus on tackling darker themes. Fickle with hobbies, can range from loom weaving to muay thai. Knows very little about digital writing past interactive storylines you might find within games. Bit concerned her analog brain may never adapt to this style of writing.
